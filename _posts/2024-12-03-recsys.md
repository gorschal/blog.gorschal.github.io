## Software as a Service Recommender Systems

SaaS Recommender systems have many challenges to their development including having to handle multi-tenancy, store and process a massive amount of data and other softer concerns like keeping a clients sensitive data safe on remote servers.

The benefits to using a SaaS recommender system is that you can pay for value with a low overhead rather than having a large upfront investment, they generally have a clear integration path for you to use, and they provide continual development and improvement while you use it.

The SaaS recommender systems are:

1. [Peerius](http://www.peerius.com/) closed, product and e-commerce focused for live and email recommendations. Active and seems very interesting, although little information about the actual product and how it works is available.
1. [Strands](http://recommender.strands.com/) is a closed, product and e-commerce focused system. I think it works by including tracking scripts (a la Google Analytics) on the website, and recommendations widgets. What I really like about Strands is their publishing of case-studies e.g. [Wireless Emporium](http://retail.strands.com/customers/wireless-emporium-case-study/) and white papers like [The Big promise of recommender systems](http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/2360/2232). Although these do not discuss the exact solutions provided, they give a good overview of their vision and goals of providing recommendations.
1. [SLI Systems Recommender](http://www.sli-systems.com/) A closed recommender system focused on e-commerce, search and mobile.
1. [Using Hadoop on Google Cloud](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.co.nz/2014/01/performance-advantages-of-the-new-google-cloud-storage-connector-for-hadoop.html) an example use of Google cloud with benchmarks from recommender system.

1. [Mr. DLib](http://mr-dlib.org) A recommender-system as-a-service for academic organisations such as digital libraries and reference managers. Mr. DLib provides 'related-article' recommendations, is open-source, and publishes most of it's [data](http://data.mr-dlib.org).
1. [Rumo](https://www.rumo.co/) is a flexible SaaS recommendation system adaptable to all entertainment industries (films, music, podcasts, video games, sports, etc.) and based on both content metadata and user behaviors. Rumo's algorithms are transparent and explainable, providing full control over the recommendation process.
1. [Froomle](https://www.froomle.ai/) is a modular recommendation platform, which focuses on serving news and e-commerce companies. They offer a variety of modules, optimized on their use case (f.e. discovery or related), business goal (f.e. CTR or conversion) and integration type (web, mail or push notifications). Their modules use state of the art machine learning techniques under the hood.
1. [Recommendations AI](https://cloud.google.com/recommendations)  deliver highly personalized product recommendations at scale. It's a part of [Google Cloud’s Discovery Solutions for Retail](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/retail-product-discovery) which provide personalized search and recommendations.

## Open Source Recommender Systems

Most of the non-SaaS recommender systems that are open-source. This may have been because recommender systems are more tailored to clients so not easily made into a product.

The open-source recommender systems are:

1. [The Universal Recommender](https://actionml.com/universal-recommender) Is built on the modern [Correlated Cross-Occurrence Algorithm](http://mahout.apache.org/users/recommender/intro-cooccurrence-spark.html) that uses many indicators of user taste, and so can target most use cases. Source on [github](https://github.com/actionml/harness/blob/develop/docs/ur_simple_usage.md) built-in to the [Harness ML](https://github.com/actionml/harness) server or as a template for the older PredictionIO server ([highest-rated template](http://predictionio.apache.org/gallery/template-gallery/)).

Not very many Non-SaaS Non-OpenSource recommender systems seem to exist. Below is a list:

1. [Dato](http://dato.com/) is a company that provides a python package and servers for business machine learning including many predictive algorithms for recommendations. They also integrate with [Apache Spark](http://blog.dato.com/using-apache-spark-with-graphlab-create) and have great blog posts like **[Why is building custom recommender systems hard? Does it have to be?](http://blog.dato.com/why-is-building-custom-recommender-systems-hard-does-it-have-to-be)**. Their customers include Pandora and StumbleUpon, must be a good product.
